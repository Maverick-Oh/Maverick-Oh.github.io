  abstract = {Graphical notation has been introduced and utilized in physics for years, but it still remains as relatively minor notation compared to the conventional plaintext notation despite its effectiveness, readability, and applicability. In this thesis, the graphical notation for vector calculus is reviewed and generalized. The essence and advantage of the graphical notation are illustrated with vector calculus as a self-contained example. Basic rules are introduced and utilized to prove some representative vector calculus identities, illustrating how concise and effective the graphical notation is. More generalized concepts and notations, such as the algebra of gamma matrices and quantum mechanical commutation relation, are reviewed to show how the notation can be modified and extended. By enabling graphical notation to be readily applied and taught in undergraduate level vector calculus, the entry barrier of graphical notation would be lowered and the practical use of the notation would be promoted. The generalization examples would encourage readers to manipulate and invent graphical notations by themselves when needed, enlarging and diversifying the use of graphical notation in general. This would lead to more concrete and efficient understanding and presentation of physics.},

  abstract = {이 논문은 이상(李箱, 본명 김해경(金海卿), 1910-1937)의 연작시 「삼차각설계도(三次角設計圖)」와 「건축무한육면각체(建築無限六面角體)」에 나타난 기하학적․물리학적 원관념에 대한 보다 구체적이고 정합적인 이해의 기조를 세우기 위한 시도이다. 이상은 당대 최신의 물리학 이론에 대한 이해를 바탕으로 4차원상에서 임의의 도형을 설계․건축하는 시도를 연작시에 남겼고, 이 과정에서 ‘삼차각’과 ‘육면각체’라는 조어를 직접 만들어 사용하였다. 이 논문은 ‘삼차각’이란 4차원 공간상에서 물체의 물리적 위치를 초구면좌표계로 나타낼 때 필요한 세 개의 각도값임을, 그리고 ‘육면각’이란 삼차각의 적분으로 얻어지는 초입체각이며, 그와 동시에 4차원상에서 한 점에서 만나는 여섯 개의 면이 이루는 각임을 해설한다. 또한 n개의 점과 그에 대응하는 육면각으로 이루어진 도형을 n-육면각체라고 부를 수 있고, 그에 따라 ‘무한-육면각체’가 4차원상의 임의의 도형을 의미함을 해설한다. 아울러, 「선에관한각서1」과 「AU MAGASIN DE NOUVEAUTES」에 나타난 차원 확장에 대해 다룬다.논문 소개 동영상: https://youtu.be/hoH1GrumJ58.
  This paper is a trial to establish the foundation of more concrete and coherent understanding of two series poems of Yi-Sang, 「Three-Dimensional Angle Blueprint(삼차각설계도, 三次角設計圖,)」 and 「Building Infinite Hexahedral-Angle Bodies(건축무한육면각체, 建築無限六面角體)」. Yi-Sang, based on his understanding on contemporary physics theories, wrote about his attempt to design and build arbitrary four-dimensional bodies on the poems. He coined and used the terms ‘three-dimensional angle’ and ‘hexahedral-angle body’. In this paper, it is explained that a three-dimensional angle is the set of three angular values from expressing the physical position of an object in four-dimensional space using the hyperspherical coordinate system, and a ‘hexahedral angle’ is the hyper-solid angle calculated from the integration of a three-dimensional angle as well as the angle made with six intersecting planes. Also, it is shown that a body that has n vertices and corresponding hexahedral angles can be called as n-hexahedral-angle body, which is followed by the notion that an ‘infinite-hexahedral-angle body’ is an arbitrary body in the four-dimensional space. On top of that, the dimension expansion that appears in 「Memorendum on lines 1」 and 「AU MAGASIN DE NOUVEAUTES」 is covered. Summary video: https://youtu.be/hoH1GrumJ58},

  abstract={Deep learning has been widely and actively used in various research areas. Recently, in gauge/gravity duality, a new deep learning technique called AdS/DL (Deep Learning) has been proposed. The goal of this paper is to explain the essence of AdS/DL in the simplest possible setups, without resorting to knowledge of gauge/gravity duality. This perspective will be useful for various physics problems: from the emergent spacetime as a neural network to classical mechanics problems. For prototypical examples, we choose simple classical mechanics problems. This method is slightly different from standard deep learning techniques in the sense that we not only have the right final answers but also obtain physical understanding of learning parameters.},

  abstract={Learning vector calculus techniques is one of the major hurdles faced by physics undergraduates. However, beginners report various difficulties dealing with the index notation due to its bulkiness. Meanwhile, there have been graphical notations for tensor algebra that are intuitive and effective in calculations and can serve as a quick mnemonic for algebraic identities. Although they have been introduced and applied in vector algebra in the educational context, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no publications that employ the graphical notation to three-dimensional Euclidean vector calculus, involving differentiation and integration of vector fields. Aiming for physics students and educators, we introduce such “graphical vector calculus,” demonstrate its pedagogical advantages, and provide a variety of exercises containing both purely mathematical identities and practical calculations in physics. The graphical notation can readily be utilized in the educational environment to not only lower the barriers in learning and practicing vector calculus but also make students interested and self-motivated to manipulate the vector calculus syntax and, on their own, heuristically comprehend the language of tensors.},

  abstract={This is the supplementary material for “Boosting Vector Calculus with the Graphical Notation.” It is written for students and introduces instructive and practical examples regarding graphical vector and tensor algebra and calculus in the physics context. Notable topics, including the ones mentioned in the main article, are as follows. Graphical proof of the Jacobi identity is discussed in P6a and its sequels in the following two sections. Next, most importantly, graphical proof of first and second derivative vector calculus identities are covered in Sections I B 1 and I B 2. Then, the strength of the graphical technique of tensor calculus is elaborated throughout Section I C. Graphical notation for general multi-index quantities is introduced in Section I C 2. Do not miss the next section, Section I C 3, to learn the “arrow pushing” that enables to efficiently denote and explain the invariance property of tensorial expressions. Finding the oblivious δ
(3)(~r) term and the calculus of multipolar fields are discussed throughout Sections I C 5 and I C 6. Section I A 4 introduces permutation symmetry of indices. Refer to the comments in A67b for an instructive example of diagrammatic perturbation in statistical mechanics. Lastly, Section I D invites the reader into the world of Feynman diagrams.},

  abstract={We developed a hard X-ray spectrometer for the purpose of measuring X-ray emission spectrum excited by using single X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) pulses. A highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) crystal was placed in the von Hamos geometry to focus X-rays of the equal energy on a specific point in detector plane. The spectrometer was tested at PAL-XFEL using Ni and NiO films. The Ni 𝐾𝛽13 X-ray emission line excited by using a single X-ray pulse was successfully resolved. If the much weaker Ni 𝐾𝛽25 line is to be observed, data must be accumulated with a few thousands of X-ray pulses. The spectrometer energy resolving power, E/ΔE, was estimated to be 7500. This spectrometer can be utilized to conduct various X-ray emission and absorption measurements using XFELs.},
