Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a PhD student at University of California, Merced.

This webpage is actively being updated; I am learning how to make it.

I am working with Prof. Anna Nierenberg on modeling and analysis of gravitationally lensed quasar systems to understand and constrain dark matter properties.

I am using the data from Hubble Space Telescope to statistically constrain the distribution of dark matter halos, which is related to their fundamental properties.

I also have worked on other projects related to the graphical notation of vector calculus, physics-informed machine learning, and Korean science poems.

Please feel free to reach out.

Thanks!
